            <br>No man is an island
            <br>No man is an island, 
           <br> Entire of itself,
            <br>Every man is a piece of the continent,            
            <br>A part of the main.
           <br> If a clod be washed away by the sea,
           <br> Europe is the less.
           <br> As well as if a promontory were.
          <br>  As well as if a manor of thy friends
         <br>   Or of thine own were:
         <br>   Any mans death diminishes me,
            <br>Because I am involved in mankind,
          <br>  And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
          <br>  It tolls for thee.
        <br> By John Donne</p>

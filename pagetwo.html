            <br>Title No Man Is An Island
            <br>No man is an island, 
           <br> Entire of itself,
            <br>Every man is a piece of the continent,            
            <br>A part of the main.
           <br> If a clod be washed away by the sea,
           <br> Europe is the less.
           <br> As well as if a promontory were.
          <br>  As well as if a manor of thy friends
         <br>   Or of thine own were:
         <br>   Any mans death diminishes me,
            <br>Because I am involved in mankind,
          <br>  And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
          <br>  It tolls for thee.
         <br> By John Donne

         <br> Title Ode To Death
         <br> when you're born
         on this earth,
         inevitably you get burned
          in a hearth,
         <br> petals and ash,
         painting the sky,
         but in a dash,
          they will all die,
         <br>life will bloom like a flower
         growing up and guiding through,
         <br>then time will devour,
         leave a legacy left after all you do,
         <br> when the glass breaks,
         opened and sand flows out,
         <br>after death takes,
         we may scream out,
         <br> how could you
         do this to me,
         <br>looking back 
         <br>at 
         <br>what 
         we had blew,
         <br>however what you dont see,
         <br>is that when a suns rises
         they also set,
         <br> eventually everyone dies,
         we all repay our debt,
         <br> dipping the pen  
         in pitch black ink,
           doesnt matter when,
         <br>only that you think,
           ideas flow to paper
         all letters tapered,
         <br>  here I write this ode to death,
          I will fight to my final breath,
         <br>but when all is said,
         and all is done,
          we all do not fight that long.
